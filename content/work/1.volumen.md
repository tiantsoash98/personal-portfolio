Starting from a personal experiment one tuesday afternoon, where I simply wanted to create a design with a bold title, Volumen evolved into a full-fledged website through collaboration with [Jamy Rasanda](https://www.instagram.com/jamyrasanda/), 3D Artist.

After creating an initial design of the homepage with free-to-use 3D renderings, I thought it would be more interesting to use custom photos. Therefore, I reached out to Jamy to create 3D renders.
<br><br>
The renders exceeded expectations, utilizing brutalist effects with rocks. Naturally, the idea emerged to continue this theme on the details page for each shape.

As a big fan of the storytelling in [Rose Island](https://rose-island.co/) by the [Tambien studio](https://tambien.studio/), with its unique layouts and highly immersive animations, I adopted some of their layouts, including the integrated image on text block, which I thought would perfectly match the desired aesthetic.

All the technologies and libraries used during the development of Volumen were learned on the fly, including Vue.js, managing page transitions with Barba.js, and handling complex animations.
